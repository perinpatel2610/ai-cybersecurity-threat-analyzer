## Overview

This application accepts raw security logs such as SSH logs, web server logs, firewall logs, and EDR-style alerts, then uses a large language model on Amazon Bedrock to analyze them for possible threats.

The system enhances analysis using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It retrieves relevant threat intelligence documents before sending the final prompt to the model, helping produce more accurate and contextual security findings.

A built-in Security Assistant chat allows users to ask follow-up questions about detected threats, recommended mitigations, and incident response steps.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 18, Vite 5 |
| Backend | Node.js 20, Express 4 |
| AI Model | Amazon Bedrock — Claude model or inference profile |
| Embeddings | Amazon Bedrock — Titan Embed Text v2 |
| Vector Search | JavaScript cosine similarity with in-memory vector index |
| AWS SDK | `@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime` v3 |
| Containerization | Docker, Docker Compose |

---

## Why This Stack

### Why React + Vite?

- **React** provides a component-based UI where the log input, findings panel, and chat assistant are isolated and reusable.
- **Vite** gives fast local development, hot reload, and simple environment variable support through `import.meta.env`.

### Why Node.js instead of Python?

- JavaScript is used across both frontend and backend, making the project easier to maintain.
- AWS SDK v3 provides strong support for Bedrock runtime integration.
- No local ML framework is required because model inference and embeddings are handled by Amazon Bedrock.
- Cosine similarity can be implemented directly in JavaScript without heavy Python ML dependencies.

### Why Express?

- Express is lightweight, widely used, and easy to structure for REST APIs.
- It supports async Bedrock API calls cleanly with `async/await`.

---

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed and running
- AWS account with Amazon Bedrock access enabled
- AWS CLI configured locally for development
- Bedrock model access in your selected region, usually `us-east-1`
- Access to:
  - A supported Claude model or inference profile
  - `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0`

---

## Setup & Running

### 1. Configure AWS credentials safely

For local development, configure AWS credentials using AWS CLI:

```bash
aws configure
```

Enter your:

```text
AWS Access Key ID
AWS Secret Access Key
Default region name: us-east-1
Default output format: json
```

Do **not** commit AWS credentials to GitHub.

For production deployment, use an **IAM Role** attached to the EC2 instance instead of storing access keys in `.env`.

---

### 2. Create backend environment file

Create `backend-node/.env`:

```env
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
BEDROCK_MODEL_ID=anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0
PORT=8000
```

You can also use another Claude model or inference profile if your AWS account has access to it. Always confirm the exact model ID from the Amazon Bedrock console.

---

### 3. Create frontend environment file

Create `frontend/.env`:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

For deployment, replace this with your deployed backend URL.

---

### 4. Start Docker Desktop

Make sure Docker Desktop is running.

---

### 5. Run with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

---

### 6. Open the app

Navigate to:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

---

## Local Development Without Docker

### Backend

```bash
cd backend-node
npm install
node --watch src/server.js
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## Environment Variables

| `PORT` | Backend server port | `8000` |

### Frontend

| Variable | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_API_URL` | Backend API URL | `http://localhost:8000` |

---

## API Reference

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/health` | Health check |
| `GET` | `/samples` | List available sample log names |
| `GET` | `/samples/:name` | Get content of a specific sample log |

}
```

Response:

```json

    }
  ],
  "rag_context_used": true,
  "raw_ai_response": "..."
}
```

### POST `/chat`

Request:

```json

}
```

Response:

```json

  "response": "The SSH brute force attack indicates repeated login attempts against the server."
}
```

## How It Works

### Log Analysis Flow

1. User pastes security logs into the UI and clicks **Analyze Threats**.
2. The frontend sends a `POST /analyze` request to the Express backend.
3. If RAG is enabled, `RAGService` embeds the log text using Amazon Titan Embed Text v2.
4. The system performs cosine similarity search against the in-memory threat intelligence vector index.
5. The top relevant threat intelligence documents are added to the prompt as context.
6. `LogAnalyzer` builds a structured prompt and instructs the model to respond in valid JSON.
7. `BedrockService` invokes Claude through Amazon Bedrock.
8. The response is parsed and returned to the frontend.
9. The UI displays the threat level, summary, findings, and remediation recommendations.

### RAG

RAG improves the analysis by giving the model relevant threat intelligence before it reviews the logs.

The system:

1. Embeds the input log text using Titan Embed Text v2.
2. Compares it against pre-embedded threat intelligence documents.
3. Retrieves the top matching documents.
4. Injects them into the Claude prompt as additional context.

This helps the model produce more specific and useful findings.

### Security Assistant Chat

The chat assistant includes the current analysis context when answering follow-up questions. This allows users to ask questions such as:

```text
Which IP should be blocked first?
What remediation steps should I take?
Is this brute-force activity?
How serious is this incident?
```

## Sample Logs

| Sample | Description |
|---|---|
| `brute_force` | SSH brute force attack with repeated failed root login attempts |
| `sql_injection` | SQL injection attempt using suspicious web request patterns |
| `malware_c2` | Malware C2 beaconing with periodic outbound connections |
| `normal` | Normal traffic with legitimate logins, API calls, and scheduled backups |

---

## Threat Intelligence Knowledge Base

The RAG system uses 8 built-in threat intelligence documents covering:

| ID | Threat Type |
|---|---|
| `brute-force-ssh` | SSH brute force attacks |
| `sql-injection` | SQL injection |
| `c2-beaconing` | Command & Control beaconing |
| `privilege-escalation` | Privilege escalation |
| `data-exfiltration` | Data exfiltration |
| `xss` | Cross-Site Scripting |
| `ransomware` | Ransomware activity |
| `lateral-movement` | Lateral movement |

Each document includes attack indicators and mitigation steps. These documents are embedded at startup and stored in memory for fast similarity search.
